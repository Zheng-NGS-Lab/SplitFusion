Description: SplitFusion is a companion data pipeline for AMP, for the detection of gene fusion based on split alignments, i.e. reads crossing fusion breakpoints, with the ability to accurately infer in-frame or out-of-frame of fusion partners of a given fusion candidate. SplitFusion also outputs example breakpoint-supporting seqeunces in FASTA format, allowing for further investigations.
